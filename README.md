### Here is a basic example on how to use a Pod and PodBuilder:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:xyz_pod/xyz_pod.dart';

final pTemperature = Pod<double>(68.0);
final pWeatherCondition = Pod<String>("Sunny");

class WeatherPods extends PodListHelper {
  const WeatherPods();
  PodList get pods => [pTemperature, pWeatherCondition];
  double get temperature => pods.elementAt(0)!.value as double;
  String get weatherCondition => pods.elementAt(1)!.value as String;
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Material(
        child: Center(
          child: Column(
            mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
            children: [
              PodListBuilder(
                pods: WeatherPods().pods,
                builder: (context, child, pods) {
                  final temperature = WeatherPods().temperature;
                  final weatherCondition = WeatherPods().weatherCondition;
                  return Text(
                    "Today is $weatherCondition and the temperature is $temperatureÂ°F.",
                  );
                },
              ),
              // ... Additional UI and Button to update Pods ...
            ],
          ),
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```
